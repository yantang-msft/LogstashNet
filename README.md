### Introduction
This is a test project to manage your logs in .Net like what Logstash does. Check out the ConfigFiles in LogstashMain project and see what it currently supports.

### Future Release
Another project in under development internally, same idea with Logstash, but slightly different configuration format.
It's cross platform (through .Net Core) and should be good from performance's perspective.
